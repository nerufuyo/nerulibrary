- Error messages are user-friendly, not revealing internals
- No print() statements in production code

### 4. ✅ File System Security
- **File Permissions:** Proper Android permissions requested
- **Storage Access:** Scoped to app-specific directories
- **Download Security:** File validation before storage
- **Cache Management:** Secure temporary file handling

**Findings:** SECURE
- Minimum necessary permissions requested
- No external storage access without explicit user consent
- Downloaded files validated for type and size
- Cache files properly cleaned up

### 5. ✅ Dependency Security
- **Third-party Libraries:** All dependencies audited
- **Version Management:** Latest stable versions used
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** No known CVEs in dependencies
- **License Compliance:** All licenses compatible

**Findings:** SECURE

class UserRepository {
  // Session management with automatic refresh
  // Secure token storage
  // Proper logout/cleanup procedures
}
```

### Data Encryption
```dart
// Local database with SQLite
class DatabaseConfig {
  // App-specific data directory
  // No external access without permissions
  // Automatic cleanup on uninstall
}
```

### Network Security
```dart
// Secure HTTP client configuration
class DioClient {
  // HTTPS enforcement
  // Request/response validation
  // Timeout configurations
  // Error handling without data exposure
}
```

### File Security
```dart
// Secure file management
class FileManager {
  // Scoped storage access
  // File type validation
  // Size limit enforcement
  // Secure temporary storage
}
```

## Recommendations Implemented

### Medium Priority Fixes Applied:
1. **Environment Variable Protection:** All API keys moved to environment variables
2. **Build Configuration:** Debug information removed from release builds

### Low Priority Enhancements:
1. **Error Message Sanitization:** All error messages reviewed for information disclosure
2. **Input Validation:** Additional validation added for user inputs

## Security Testing Results

### Penetration Testing
- ✅ **SQL Injection:** Not applicable (using SQLite with parameterized queries)
- ✅ **XSS Attacks:** Not applicable (native Flutter app)
- ✅ **Authentication Bypass:** Failed (Supabase security controls effective)
- ✅ **Data Exposure:** No sensitive data found in logs or errors
- ✅ **File System Access:** Properly restricted to app scope

### Vulnerability Scanning
- ✅ **Dependency Scan:** No CVEs found in current dependencies
- ✅ **Code Analysis:** Static analysis completed with no security issues
- ✅ **Permission Analysis:** Only necessary permissions requested

### Privacy Compliance
- ✅ **Data Collection:** Minimal data collection, user-controlled
- ✅ **Data Sharing:** No data shared with third parties
- ✅ **User Consent:** Clear permission requests with explanations
- ✅ **Data Retention:** User-controlled data management
